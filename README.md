Topic: "Mixed-Effects Location Scale Models on Health Behaviors to Academic Performance via Affect: Modeling Variances"

Abstract: 
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data collection is a tool that allows
subjects to report the momentary state of the variables in their real-time environment
repeatedly. In the study of “How Health Behaviors Relate to Academic
Performance via Affect: An Intensive Longitudinal Study”, the investigators
implemented EMA data collection, studied the between-person level
and within-person level using mixed-effects regression models and achieved
some significant results [14]. For this study, we aim to conduct a more extensive
analysis on their data by modeling the variances using mixed-effects
location scale model, a model that permits subjects to vary their means (location
effects) and subjects’ variability (scale effects). By implementing this
model to this existing study, some novel findings are discovered. We conclude
that daily higher level of negative affect is associate with more erratic learning
goal achievement.
